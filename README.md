# traffic-light-control-project ðŸš¦ðŸš¦
Welcome to the Traffic Light Control System project! This project is designed to control a set of traffic lights using a PIC16F877A microcontroller. It features both automatic and manual modes of operation, allowing the user to simulate traffic light sequences in a way that is both practical and educational.
## ðŸ“‹ Project Description
This project involves developing a traffic light controller using a PIC16f877A microcontroller. The system has two operational modes: Automatic and Manual.
 **Automatic Mode**: the traffic lights for West and South streets operate on a predefined schedule. The West street cycle is 15 seconds red, 3 seconds yellow, and 20 seconds green. The South street cycle is 23 seconds red, 3 seconds yellow, and 12 seconds green.

**Manual Mode**: a switch allows for a quick change between the two streets. A 3-second yellow light transition is maintained between color changes in both modes.
